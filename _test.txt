Time to get meta, and test a testing exercise. :)

party.py
--------

First, import our server and the doctest module, so we can run doctests:

    >>> import party
    >>> import doctest

Now, let's just run the doctests and make sure the code we ship behaves as it
should. Students haven't added any tests yet, so there should be no attempts
and no failures to report:

    >>> doctest.testmod(party).attempted
    0
    >>> doctest.testmod(party).failed
    0

Hooray!

tests.py
--------

Now, import the file containing unittest code for Further Study, as well as
the unittest module:

    >>> from tests import PartyTests
    >>> import unittest

To run our class' test suite, we'll have to load it and use a class from
unittest to actually do the driving. All we should see for now is a bunch of
FIXMEs, because Balloonicorn went off dancing instead of finishing her tests.

    >>> suite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(PartyTests)
    >>> result = unittest.TextTestRunner().run(suite)
